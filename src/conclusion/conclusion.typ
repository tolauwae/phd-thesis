This dissertation introduced several new ways of debugging embedded systems, based on a virtual machine approach and sound debugging semantics.
While we have discussed the conclusions we draw for each of the contributions in their respective chapters, we now consider the bigger picture one last time.
In this final chapter, we sum up again the overarching challenges we set out to address, and briefly summarize our contributions in relation to these challenges, and discuss future directions for each segment.

== Remote debugging for WebAssembly

#C1

Using the WebAssembly virtual machine approach, :!as a remote debugging target, we can leverage the existing tooling and ecosystem around WebAssembly to provide a powerful debugging experience.

== Stateful out-of-place debugging

#C2

#C3

== Multiverse debugging

#C4

== Managed testing
