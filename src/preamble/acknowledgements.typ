// Christophe
This dissertation could not have been written without the help and support of a long list of people.
My words of thanks could easily fill an entire book, but instead I limit my acknowledgements here to two pages.

First and foremost, I must thank my supervisor _Christophe Scholliers_ for being a tremendous tutor and teacher. // these past four years.
//Christophe truly wants his students to succeed, and saves no effort when introducing them to every aspect of the scientific world.
I am forever grateful for the guidance, enthusiasm, and the opportunities Christophe provided.

// (Peter)
I want to thank my co-supervisor _Peter Dawyndt_, and // who is always generous with his time 
// The jury
// #note[I would like to thank _Bart Mesuere_ for his readiness to serve on the board.]
the members of the examination board, _Robert Hirschfeld_, _Quentin Stiévenart_, _Bart Coppens_, _Yvan Saeys_, and _Chris Cornelis_ for their time and valued feedback on the early manuscript. //I enjoyed the great discussion during the internal defence.
I would like to thank _Bart Mesuere_ for his readiness to serve on the board. //and for being a great lecturer and colleague.

I wish to thank all my collaborators and co-authors.
// Robbert
An especially grateful thanks goes to _Robbert Gurdeep Singh_ as the creator of the WARDuino virtual machine.
In his role as my predecessor in the lab, Robbert's guidance during my first year as a predoctoral student was invaluable.
// Elisa
Another important guide was _Elisa González Boix_.
Her perspective on my work was always insightful, and very impactful.
It was great working together on the MPLR paper and DEBT, and it is always a pleasure to visit the VUB.
I am looking forward to our future collaborations.

// Matteo
Staying with the VUB for a moment, special thanks need to go to _Matteo Marra_ for his original work on out-of-place debugging without which @chapter:oop would not exist.
// Carlos
Similar thanks go to _Carlos Rojas Castillo_ for his work on out-of-place debugging on WARDuino, and the great collaboration during the writing and coding of the MPLR paper---which is still a large part of @chapter:oop. Our meetings together were always both enjoyable and fruitful.

// Stefan
Without _Stefan Marr_ and the research stay at his lab in Kent, @chapter:testing would not have been written.
I would like to thank him and his students, _Octave Larose_ and _Sophie Kaleba_, for their generous welcome.
//Stefan had a bigger impact on this dissertation and on me as a young researcher than he would like to think, I am very thankful for his advice throughout the years.
// Internationale contacten: Octave Larose and Sophie Kaleba

// Maarten
Last but not least, I want to thank _Maarten Steevens_ for being a dream collaborator the past two years.
I really enjoyed working on the multiverse debugger together. Hopefully, we can continue to work together in the future.
In fact I want to thank _Jonas Sys_ here too, as the other new TOPL member.
The last year at the lab has been so rewarding with the arrival of our two latest members, and I am sure that the lab will produce a lot of fantastic research in the next few years thanks to Jonas and Maarten.

I wish to thank _Francisco Ferreira Ruiz_ for providing the hardware that enabled the research on multiverse debugging in @chap:multiverse.

// Collega's: Jonathan, Charlotte, Niko, Steven, Jorg en anderen
I want to thank my past and present colleagues at WINST (formerly TWIST) for making the office really a joyful place to be.
I am reminded of a speech by Hugh Laurie, #note[Permit me to paraphrase.]_"I know everyone says they have wonderful [colleagues], and logically that can't be the case. Somebody somewhere is working with a crew of drunken thieves, but it is not me"_.
//My fellow PhD students are each of them great people, and I am grateful that I may call many of them my friends.

There are too many names to list so allow me to limit myself to handful of people.
Thanks go first to _Jonathan Peck_ for being a wonderful office mate whose knowledge and intellect are always inspiring.
I want to thank _Charlotte Van Petegem_ as the cornerstone of the wonderful atmosphere at TWIST during my time, _Niko Strijbol_ for the many laughs and his feedback on the typography of this book, and _Steven Van Overberghe_ for indulging my weird mathematics questions.
Thanks likewise go to _Thomas Van Mullem_ for being an awesome master student and wonderful colleague.

I want to thank _Rien Maertens_ for all his help with the administrative challenges of finishing a PhD.
I could always rely on Rien for a quick and helpful answer to any question I had.


// Jorg, Simon, Feng, Heidi, Felix, Simon, Mustapha, ... // TODO ?

// de vakgroep (ook alle lesgevers van de opleiding)
I want to thank the entire WINST departement, and especially all the lecturers I had through my bachelor and master eduction at Ghent University.
One should not admit to having favorites, but I do want to explicitly thank a few people not previously mentioned---_Felix Van der Jeugt_, _Nico Van Cleemput_, and _Jan Goedgebeur_.

I would also like to thank the people who mean a great deal to me in a no professional capacity, my friends and family.

// Vrienden: Jorg, Max, Wout, Kieran, Jasper, Michiel, the maestro Tibo, Alex, Nicole, Christine
I want to thank Bachachus for being such an amazing and inseperable group of friends, thank you _Jorg_, _Max_, _Wout_, _Kieran_ and _Jasper_.
I want to thank _Tibo_ and _Michiel_ for our time at university together.
Finally, I wish to thank my oldest friends, _Christine_, _Nicole_, and _Alex_ for their lifelong friendship.

// Xiaoyu
Special loving thanks go to my darling _Xiaoyu_ (#text(size: small, "晓雨")) for bringing a spark to my life that fuels me to reach higher and further than I ever could alone.

// Zussen en mama
Finally, I want to thank my family, _mama_, _papa_, _Fien_ and _Anna_ for everything.
There is much to be thankful for, but for this dissertation I want to thank Fien for helping to proofread the early manuscript. // at a moment's notice.


// TODO send email with thank you to Baudouin with pdf
